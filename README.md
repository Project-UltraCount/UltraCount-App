# Project UltraCount
**(formerly named Project IREye)**
</div>

<span><p style="color: red;">_**This is code for the software Android application.**_</p></span>

## Overview
During the COVID-19 period, we, an engineering team of six under the Hwa Chong Entrepreneurship Programme, initiated a pedestrian counter project aimed at reinforcing our school's security management. Using ultrasonic sensors, we designed a mobile application to communicate in real-time, providing data about the number of students inside the campus for use by security personnel.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Provides up-to-date information on the number of students on campus.
- **Ultrasonic Sensors**: Utilized for accurate pedestrian counting.
- **Raspberry Pi-based Hardware**: Central processing unit for data collection and transmission.
- **Android Application**: Displays real-time figures for security personnel.
- **IoT Integration**: API protocols used to incorporate IoT functionalities in both hardware and software.
- **Cloud Storage and Remote Control**: Established data transmission using Aliyun's Object Storage Service and realized hardware remote control via the Aliyun IoT platform using MQTT protocols.

## Project Description
In this collaborative effort, our contributions included:
- **PCB Design**: Designing the PCB for the Raspberry Pi-based hardware.
- **Ultrasonic Counter Programming**: Developing the counter logic using Python.
- **Android Application Development**: Programming the application to display real-time figures using Java and establishing data transmission using the Object Storage Service by Aliyun as our cloud server.
- **IoT Functionality**: Integrating IoT functionalities using API protocols.
- **Remote Control Implementation**: Realizing hardware remote control on the Android app using the Aliyun IoT platform based on MQTT protocols and message transmission between the broker and the hardware client.

## Project Development
1. **Design and Prototyping**:
    - Created and tested multiple PCB prototypes to ensure reliability and accuracy.
    - Developed the ultrasonic counting mechanism and integrated it with the Raspberry Pi.

2. **Software Development**:
    - Programmed the ultrasonic counter using Python to interface with the Raspberry Pi.
    - Collaborated on the development of an Android application to display real-time data using Java.

3. **IoT Integration**:
    - Implemented API protocols to facilitate communication between the hardware and software components.
    - Ensured seamless data transmission and real-time updates.

4. **Cloud Storage and Remote Control**:
    - Established data transmission using the Object Storage Service by Aliyun as our cloud server.
    - Realized hardware remote control on the Android app using the Aliyun IoT platform based on MQTT protocols.
    - Programmed message transmission between the broker and the hardware client.
